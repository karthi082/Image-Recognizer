An image recognizer allows users to upload an image and identifies its contents using machine learning models or AI services. The process typically involves uploading an image file, which is then processed by a pre-trained model to classify or detect objects. The results are displayed to the user, such as identifying animals, objects, or text in the image. This can be implemented in the browser using TensorFlow.js or by integrating cloud-based recognition APIs.
